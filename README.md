# Akka Streams Kafka Sample #

This is a very simple example project to start exploring Kafka with Akka Streams. 

To run this example you must have a running Kafka instance.
You can play with the values in the SampleApp and see what happens. :)
 
- host: Kafka Host
- port: Kafka Port
- topic: Kafka Topic
- startAtOffset: Will change the starting point for the consumer
